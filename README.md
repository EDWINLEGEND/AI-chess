# Duh! Chess üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Obsolete


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Edwin Shaju Malakaran - Christ College of Engineering
- Member 2: Gautham Madhav - Christ College of Engineering 

### Project Description
A chess game where YOU don't have to play! AI makes ALL the moves - even yours! Sit back, relax, and watch Marvel vs DC superheroes play chess while you literally do nothing. **"Eat 5 star. Do nothing."**

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone plays chess against AI, but that still requires YOU to think and make moves! Why should humans be burdened with the exhausting task of playing their own game? The stress of decision-making in chess is clearly the biggest problem facing gamers today.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We eliminated the most annoying part of chess - YOUR participation! Our revolutionary AI vs AI system makes moves for BOTH players, so you can experience chess without the burden of actually playing. We made it Marvel vs DC themed with live commentary to make watching your own uselessness entertaining!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Vite
- **Chess Logic**: Chess.js library
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with animations and gradients
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Oswald, Clash Display Variable)
- **Assets**: Custom SVG character pieces for Marvel and DC heroes
- **AI Engine**: Mock Stockfish implementation for automated gameplay

For Hardware:
- Modern web browser
- Computer/laptop with internet connection
- No additional hardware requirements

### Implementation
For Software:

# Architecture Overview
The application follows a modern React architecture with custom components designed to eliminate user interaction:

**Core Components:**
- `SimpleChessArena.jsx` - Main game controller that prevents user input
- `CustomChessBoard.jsx` - Custom chess board with superhero piece rendering
- `ErrorBoundary.jsx` - Handles errors gracefully while you do nothing

**Key Features Implementation:**
- **Automatic Gameplay**: Uses `setTimeout` with 2-second intervals (1.5s animation + 0.5s pause)
- **Piece Identity Tracking**: `pieceTracker` state maintains character identities throughout the game
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS `@keyframes` with 1.5-second duration for piece movements
- **Live Commentary**: Real-time move descriptions using character names
- **Captured Pieces Display**: Shows defeated heroes with original character SVGs

**Anti-User Systems:**
- No click handlers on chess pieces (you can't interfere!)
- AI makes moves for both Marvel and DC sides
- Single "Start" button - your only allowed interaction
- Game runs completely autonomously once started

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI-chess.git
cd AI-chess
npm install
```

# Development Run
```bash
npm run dev
```

# Live Demo
