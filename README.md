# Duh! Chess üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Code Warriors


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Edwin Shaju Malakaran - Christ College of Engineering
- Member 2: Gautham Madhav - Christ College of Engineering 

### Project Description
A superhero-themed AI vs AI chess game featuring Marvel and DC characters with custom visuals, smooth animations, and live commentary. Watch Iron Man battle Superman while Thor takes on The Flash in an epic chess showdown!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Regular chess is boring! Who wants to see generic pieces when you could watch superheroes duke it out on a chessboard? Also, humans are too slow and make mistakes - we need AI vs AI battles for maximum entertainment value.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an AI vs AI chess arena where Marvel Avengers fight against DC Justice League members, complete with character-specific pieces, smooth animations, live commentary, and captured piece displays. Because apparently the world needed to know who would win: Doctor Strange or Martian Manhunter?

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Vite

- **Assets**: Custom SVG character pieces for Marvel and DC heroes
- **AI Engine**: Mock Stockfish implementation for automated gameplay

For Hardware:
- Modern web browser
- Computer/laptop with internet connection
- No additional hardware requirements

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
