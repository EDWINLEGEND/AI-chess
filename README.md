# Duh! Chess üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Code Warriors


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Edwin Shaju Malakaran - Christ College of Engineering
- Member 2: Gautham Madhav - Christ College of Engineering 

### Project Description
A chess game where YOU don't have to play! AI makes ALL the moves - even yours! Sit back, relax, and watch Marvel vs DC superheroes play chess while you literally do nothing. **"Eat 5 star. Do nothing."**

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone plays chess against AI, but that still requires YOU to think and make moves! Why should humans be burdened with the exhausting task of playing their own game? The stress of decision-making in chess is clearly the biggest problem facing gamers today.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We eliminated the most annoying part of chess - YOUR participation! Our revolutionary AI vs AI system makes moves for BOTH players, so you can experience chess without the burden of actually playing. We made it Marvel vs DC themed with live commentary to make watching your own uselessness entertaining!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Vite
- **Chess Logic**: Chess.js library
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with animations and gradients
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Oswald, Clash Display Variable)
- **Assets**: Custom SVG character pieces for Marvel and DC heroes
- **AI Engine**: Mock Stockfish implementation for automated gameplay

For Hardware:
- Modern web browser
- Computer/laptop with internet connection
- No additional hardware requirements

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI-chess.git
cd AI-chess
npm install
```

# Run
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to start doing absolutely nothing while watching the superhero chess battle!
